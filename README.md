So that I have access to a resource/diary that contains relevant course notes to be used throughout the bootcamp
- What problem does it solve?
It consolidates all of my learning notes and history into a single resource, rather that it being spread throughout several resources on my PC.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

It will act as a source for all notes on the topics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git.

If we open the devtools console, we can see Javascript running on the HTML framework, and styled using the CSS language.

It will list the topics we learned from the prework and choose a topic for us to study first. (if we cannot choose one ourselves).

## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
